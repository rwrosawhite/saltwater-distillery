## Our Story

Saltwater Distillery is a fictional craft distillery located on a rugged,
wind-swept coastline. The concept focuses on small-batch spirits that balance
clean, modern design with a strong sense of place.

Our mission is to bottle the feeling of a clear coastal evening: calm, bright,
and gently salted by the sea breeze.

## How We Craft

We imagine a production process built around:

- Carefully sourced grains, molasses, and botanicals  
- Copper pot stills designed for small batches  
- Experimentation with coastal ingredients such as kelp, sea salt, and citrus  

Each release is built to be approachable for casual drinkers but interesting for
curious enthusiasts.

## Tasting Room & Experiences

The fictional Saltwater tasting room offers:

- Guided spirit flights with tasting notes  
- Distillery walkthroughs explaining the basic production steps  
- Limited seasonal cocktails featuring our flagship gin and rum  

## Who Saltwater Distillery Serves

Saltwater Distillery is aimed at coastal visitors, local residents, and
hospitality partners who want distinctive, story-driven spirits to feature in
their bars, restaurants, or events.
